# Cracking the coding interview.
My solutions to the Cracking the Coding Interview book programming questions.  

[Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, is a book that shows tips and other relevant information about the process of a coding interview at a large tech company. The book reviews all the important algorithms and data structures that make up the interviews, across 189 programming questions. This repository is a collection of all my answers to the questions, divided by chapters. Every folder of the repository corresponds to a chapter in the book.
